# Mini Monsters battle game 
The mini monsters battle game was my idea for this project that i originally planned to center around a pokemon style battle game. I very quickly learned that the scope i was reaching for with the time i had was not going to work well together, leading me to create this much lighter adaptation of turn based combat. I have, in this game, pitted 2 pixel art characters against each other allowing the user to play the slightly more powerful of the 2.
