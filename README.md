# Mini Monsters battle game 
The mini monsters battle game was my idea for this project that i originally planned to center around a pokemon style battle game. I very quickly learned that the scope i was reaching for with the time i had was not going to work well together, leading me to create this much lighter adaptation of turn based combat. I have, in this game, pitted 2 pixel art characters against each other allowing the user to play the slightly more powerful of the 2. The site is currently live here: [Mini monsters Github pages](https://jakemcp97.github.io/Project2-Mini-Monsters/index.html)

## UX
I initially started designing my UX on pen and paper and roughly transcribed my ideas onto balsamiq as you can see below. 
I intended on focusing more on the backend of this website and succeeded in doing so because as you can on the live site, its not as pretty as it could be. Mainly, i wanted a functional little game that would get some endorphins flowing when you click to win!
